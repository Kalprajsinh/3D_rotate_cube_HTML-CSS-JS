> The 3D rotation of a cube adds an interactive and dynamic element to a web page, making it visually appealing and immersive.
<br>A 3D rotating cube is a graphical representation of a cube that can be animated to rotate in three dimensions.<br>
To achieve the rotation effect, JavaScript is used to handle user input or trigger the animation.

- In addition to rotation, you can also change the size of the cube. By adjusting the CSS styles of the cube element, you can modify its width, height, and depth to control its overall size. For example, you can set specific pixel values or use relative units like percentages to make the cube larger or smaller. Experimenting with different size values can help achieve the desired visual effect.
